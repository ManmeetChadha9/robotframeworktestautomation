The Python Keyword based Test Automation framework is a tool built using Robotframework and Python custom libraries and uses the inbuilt python features.

It uses:
* Robot Framework libraries
* Selenium libraries
* Panda library
* Requests library 
* Xlrd library
* Custom python code for keyword generation
  
The client's requirement was a test automation framework, which could be used and maintained easily. Hence took the Action Keyword approach.
The test suites in robot framework get automatically generated based on input in the XL File where the non-technical tester can write test cases, using keywords.
